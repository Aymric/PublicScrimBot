# PublicScrimBot
On weekends when there's no clash, my friends and I get bored. Based on this observation, we would like to create a public Discord server where people can sign up to participate in a tournament in the same format as a clash (8 teams of 5 people). With the help of the Tournament API, we could automate the matchmaking and make this project viable.

The project's economic model would be based on volunteering, with no cash prizes and no entry fees. Players would be rewarded with a leaderboard showcasing the best players. The Tournament API is essential for managing the matchmakings and obtaining more data about the games to create personalized summaries.

Ultimately, the entire system would operate through a Discord bot on a public server to reach a large audience. Due to the inability to work on the Tournament API, the project is not very advanced, but we can hope for a version 1 in the coming months if this project is accepted.
